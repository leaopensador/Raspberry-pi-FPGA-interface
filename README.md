# Raspberry-pi-FPGA-interface
In this repository, applications of Raspberry pi (RPi) and FPGA interface are under progress. RPi acts as a web server which taken user inputs and displays outputs via web browser. Towards the FPGA end, the RPi also configures the FPGA using bit file and opens additional communication channels, eg SPI, I2C, etc.
